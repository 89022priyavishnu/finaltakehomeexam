# Project 1

For this project, we will have high-level project instructions in the first section of this readme. If you find yourself confused about how to implement a specific step, there are more detailed instructions/hints in the second section of the readme that you can reference, however try to tackle each step yourselves first before referencing the hints.

**Note:** The skeleton project we have created for you already implements sign up and sign in. Though this course will not cover the details of sign up and sign in, we know many of you will want to have sign up and sign in for your final projects, so here is the [link to a really simple and quick way to setup an entire Rails app with user authentication (and frontend framework) already implemented](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-devise#generate). All you have to do to set up a base app is follow the instructions in the *Generate* section. This is what we used to create the foundation of this project!

Throughout this project you will be creating a PokePortal, a mysterious realm where you will be able to:

* Capture Pokemon
* View your Pokemon
* View other trainers' Pokemon
* Damage and destroy other trainers' Pokemon
